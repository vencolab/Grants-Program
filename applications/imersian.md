## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Imersian / Funjo aims to be an open metaverse that seamlessly blends digital experiences within the real world built for creators to their communities.

### Overview

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have evolved from a nascent exploration to a disruptive blockchain technology due to their inherent qualities - each token is unique. It has been key in verifying digital ownership utilizing blockchain technologies with many early applications and use cases, such as collectibles, digital art, and digital assets.

In addition, 3D and immersive technologies have seen significant growth in the past two years, with the concept of the metaverse taking center stage. The need for web-based 3D experiences is evident across various industry verticals including gaming, entertainment, and marketing. The metaverse value is estimated to be $800 billion by 2024.

Scalable metaverse experiences through virtual reality (VR) are still in their infancy, primarily due to hardware limitations, but augmented reality is well-positioned to drive mass adoption. 

We have all seen AR's capability in entertainment and mass engagement through Pokémon Go. This technology will play a significant role in shaping the future of social discourse, as there will be an estimated  [1.7B mobile augmented reality](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1278840/united-states-adults-who-have-heard-of-facebook-metaverse/) (AR) users worldwide by 2024. 
In 2020, the mobile augmented reality (AR) market was worth $6.87B,  [forecasted to reach 26 billion U.S. dollars by 2025.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1278840/united-states-adults-who-have-heard-of-facebook-metaverse/)

Social platforms were key in onboarding billions of global users to the internet as we currently know it. Although the value of Web3 cannot be understated, it currently lacks the social drivers that enable users to connect and interact through the web3 infrastructure.

Imersian is platform where individuals, projects, and institutions can:

- Create decentralized creator profiles that to use across various dApps.
- Create and participate in AR experiences using no-code solution
- Curate their collections for sharing and socializing.

#### Goals


- Provide a scalable, interactive, and decentralized platform for building engaging experiences.
- Make 3D and AR more accessible
- Build world-leading AR experiences and tools
Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details

“The winning long-term plays [I like] in the NFT space are infrastructure related, which will outperform - by a wide margin - the expected value of even the bluest chip NFT projects.”
-The Messari Report, 2022'

Funjo aims to be an open metaverse that seamlessly blends digital experiences within the real world built by creators for their communities.

Funjo is platform where individuals, projects, and institutions can:

Create decentralized creator profiles that to use across various dApps.
Create and participate in AR experiences using no-code solution
Curate their collections for sharing and socializing.
In order to execute our vision, the platform will initially consist of the following components:

#### Decentralized Creator Profiles
<img src="https://whitepaper.funjo.app/static/social-profiles-laptop.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
The core component of our platform creates a decentralized creator profile for every creator, collector, and organization signing up. With a profile, users can access all the features of the platform. They can

Aggregate NFTs from chains and display them in a cohesive dashboard
Search and interact with other user-profiles and their NFTs. 
Access and create AR experiences and participate in others' creations.

#3D and AR Studio
The Funjo studio is a no-code scene builder for anyone to create 3D and AR experiences on the web. Anyone can contribute to building AR experiences and metaverses for their communities. 3D Creators can upload and share 3D content as NFTs for users to use in their experiences. Users can also utilize their existing 2D NFTs to create scenes.

#### AR Galleries and Quests
<img src="https://whitepaper.funjo.app/static/location-ar-ipad.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
Users can leverage our Studio to build 3D and AR experiences from their NFT Albums to create interactive NFT Showcases. Exhibitions, galleries, and retail outlets can leverage this tool to create location-based AR experiences using our platform.

NFTs can be used to create interactive AR quests, with game creators able to reward winners with NFTs from their collections.

#### AR Gaming
<img src="https://whitepaper.funjo.app/static/ar-mobile.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
Individuals and projects can leverage our Studio and game templates to compose distributed AR games. These can be in the form of mini-games or location-based AR quests to engage their communities; be it collectors, creators, or customers.

Game creators will have the ability to create in-game NFT assets for their users to collect and build.

The Technology Stack to be used will be composed of: 
- Lens Protocol/ or alternatives within the Polkadot ecosystem (open to suggestions) 
- AR Weave for NFT storage 
- 
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- 
- Imersian Platform - https://portal.imersian.com
- PoC - https://beta.funjo.app/gallery
- 
- The Project is _not_: 
  - a virtual world 
  - a VR platform 
  - a not-for-profit
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- our core audience are creators and brands who wish to create AR experiences, and Collectors who participate in the AR experiences.
- our project is built for  
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- Our project provides an Open AR Layer for the metaverse. 
- There are no similar projects with a focus on AR Metaverses

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
